          just about
          academic brilliance. Our students come to us from different socio- political, economical, cultural background, but they share common bonds: they value learnng ,respect each other and appreciate the skills and expertise of their teachers and friends. We believe that students are individuals with rights and responsibilities therefore; we assist students to progressively accept more responsibility for self-discipline, to develop self respect, to contribute to the community, to develop a love of learning, and to strive for excellence.<br>
          We are a comprehensive, co-educational school, offering an environment that reflects our society and better prepares students for their future lives as an honest democratic citizen of Nepal who can lead the nation tomorrow.<br>
          Meeting the needs of each and every student is very important to us. In addition to the courses here at Kavya, junior and senior students are given the opportunity to partake in wide variety of extra-curricular activities including clubs and inter-scholastic sports.<br>
          Our goal is to provide all students with the opportunity to perform to their personal best and to develop important life skills as good citizens and leaders in our global society. The learning environment at Kavya emphasizes the global future that our students will be a part of. Increasingly, they will interact globally to innovate, solve problems, communicate and collaborate with people from different cultures all over the world.<br>
          I invite you to continue visiting our website and to ultimately partnering with you in the development and nurturing of your son or daughter as he or she begins or continues their exciting school years.
